            <h1>How to find a shiny Pokémon using Mass Outbreaks</h1>
            <p>
                Shiny hunting in Mass Outbreaks is advisable (if you have an outbreak of interest)
                as shiny rates are higher. To do so, you’ll need to do the following.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Find the Mass Outbreak that you want to shiny hunt. (You can change the date on
                    your Nintendo Switch to get a different set of outbreaks. They also change at
                    midnight.)
                </li>

                <li>Save your game in case something goes wrong.</li>

                <li>
                    Defeat 60 of the mass outbreak Pokémon. There is no way to 100% track this in
                    game, so you’ll need to manually count and keep tabs on it. There will be
                    messages that note that the number of Pokémon in the outbreak is decreasing
                    every 20-30 Pokémon defeated, so you can use this to help keep track. When it
                    says the number of Pokémon is “definitely getting lower,” that means you’ve
                    knocked out at least 50 Pokémon. Be careful not to overhunt the Pokémon, as this
                    can cause the outbreak to end. This typically requires you to defeat over 100 of
                    the Pokémon. (Restart your game if this happens.) Note that this is not a
                    “chain” as used in previous Pokémon games. You can battle other Pokémon between
                    the 60, run from battles, leave the outbreak and come back, etc. There is no
                    “chain” to break.
                </li>
                <li>Save your game again once you’re sure you’ve defeated at least 60.</li>
                <li>
                    If you have Herba Mystica, make a sandwich for the outbreak Pokémon’s type using
                    the recipes above. Rates are quite high even without the Sparkling Power
                    sandwich, so don’t stress if you don’t have any Herba Mystica.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Run in and out of the outbreak area to despawn and respawn the Pokémon,
                    refreshing for shinies. If you’re hunting for a Pokémon where it’s hard to tell
                    if it’s shiny, you can use the auto-battle feature, as your Pokémon will refuse
                    to fight the wild Pokémon if it’s shiny.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the outbreak ends (from accidentally defeating too many) or if your 30-minute
                    sandwich window expires, close your game and repeat steps 5-7 until you get your
                    desired shiny.
                </li>
            </ol>
            If the Pokémon is in a place where it’s convenient to set up a picnic, you can set up
            and then quickly take down a picnic to despawn and respawn all the Pokémon in the area,
            allowing you to quickly look for shinies. This method is referred to as the “picnic
            method,” but it obviously doesn’t work in water or on some inconveniently steep cliff
            sides.
