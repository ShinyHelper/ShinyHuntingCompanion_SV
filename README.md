# Shiny Hunting Companion

Pokemon is a popular game series where players can collect creatures called pokemon. Rarely, players can find alternate forms of pokemon which are known as "shiny" pokemon. These shiny forms are exceedingly rare, however, there are some known strategies to improve a players chances of encountering one. This app was developed as a tool to assist in the hunting of shiny pokemon in the Pokemon Scarlet/Violet games. 
It includes a counter to track outbreak pokemon. A pokedex to provide info on each pokemon, including: an image of both their default and shiny forms, warnings for any self-harming moves the pokemon may have, and a recommended sandwiches list to assist in shiny hunting. As well as a list of all recommended sandwiches, and a brief shiny-hunting guide.

# Routes - 
There are 4 available routes in this app:
### /guide - A page containing a guide on how to hunt for shiny pokemon
### /sandwiches - A page containing a list of recommended sandwiches
### /counter - A page to track how many pokemon have been cleared in a given outbreak
### /search/:pokemon - Each pokemon has a separate page containing information related to that pokemon. These pages are reachable by searching using the searchbar, as some pokemon have specific naming conventions: e.g. Morpeko-full-belly or Tauros-paldea-combat-breed


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
